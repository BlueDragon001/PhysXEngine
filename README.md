# PhysXEngine


## Description
It's a basic and very early Physics Engine for Unity with Basic Rigid body Physics including a Collision system, Gravity e.t.c and It has a custom Math Library. Feel free to Fork/Clone/Download this repo and build on top of it. I'll be updating the engine and Documentation in the future.

P.S. It's a very early engine, It might not work properly and contain a lot of Bugs.

## Usage/Installation
Simply Copy this Repo into your Unity project. Delete /Main/PhysXEngine/PhysXEngine.asmdef if you don't use any Assembly Definition. And Include /Main/PhysXEngine/PhysXEngine.asmdef in your other Assembly Definition if you're using one.
